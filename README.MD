# Not-Padd
A _small_ tool designed to be used by other programs to show Windows Notepad style popups. It has a CLI that is very easy to use:
```
padd.exe "<content>"
```
Multiple windows can be opened like this:
```
padd.exe <window 1 content> <window 2 content> <etc...>
```
This is heavily inspired by Not-epad in [Desktop Goose](https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose), so thanks to [Samperson](https://samperson.itch.io) for making that!
